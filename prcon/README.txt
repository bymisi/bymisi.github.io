PHPrcon V0.6.3 for Halflife Server
--------------------------------

PHPrcon is a collection of PHP scripts that makes you able to remotely administrate a Halflife or HalflifeMod Server through a webinterface. This little project has its origin in a project I had to do for my studies at the University of Paderborn. The original project was bigger and more comfortabel, with a complete commando list, multiuser and multiserver management. I decided to derive a smaller version of this project, so that you just have to unpack a bunch of scripts, do a little configuration and give it a GO.

Systemrequirements
------------------

Server side:
- Any Webserver (PHP as pure CGI may cause problems)
- PHP V4.2.0 >=
(It has been developed and tested with Xitami V3.2.2 and PHP V4.2.3 as webserver module)

Client side:
- Any Webbrowser


Installation Instructions
-------------------------

Unpack all files in a directory on your Webserver. Create a link on your Website to "rcon_index.php" to use the rcon part or to "info_index.php" to use the public part of PHPrcon. To configure PHPrcon open "./install/install.php" in your webbrowser. If you want to do configuration stuff by yourself modify "./config.php" in your main PHPrcon folder to fit your Game- and Webserver. The use of "./install/install.php" is recommended.

config.php:

<?php 
  //User 
  //Name 
  $config_user_name = "rcon"; 
  //Password 
  $config_user_password = "rcon"; 
   
   
  //Gameserver 
  //IP or Domain Name 
  $config_server_ip = "gameserver.ip.here"; 
  //Port 
  $config_server_port = "27015"; 
  //rcon password 
  $config_server_password = "password"; 
  //Number of pages of maps that are sent from the server 
  $config_map_amount = 1; 
   
   
  //relative path to the selected theme, from PHPrcon root dir 
  $config_theme = "basic"; 

  //1 = a small helptext will be displayed on top of every page; 0 = no helptext 
  $config_helptext = 1; 

  //language of PHPrcon 
  $config_language = "english"; 

  //1 = PHPrcon is running on the same server as your Gameserver, 0 = PHPrcon is running anywhere 
  $config_localserver = 1; 

  //List of Config Files 
  //absolute path to the xxxx.cfg that should be editable in PHPrcon (if $localserver = 0 this has no effect at all) 
  $config_file[1] = "/usr/local/hl/server.cfg";
  $config_file[2] = "/usr/local/hl/config.cfg";
   
?> 


- $config_user_name and $config_user_pwd are the authentication information PHPrcon askes from, when your are logging in.

- $config_server_ip, $config_server_port and $config_server_password specify your Halflifeserver. $config_server_ip may be a pure IP or a domainname. See "Troubleshooting" for information.

- $config_map_amount is the number of pages of maps that are sent from the gameserver

- $config_theme specifies the theme you want to use. You may build your own theme. For instructions how to build your own themes see http://www.phprcon.net templates section

- $config_language specifies the language of PHPrcon. For a list of available languages see http://www.phprcon.net download section

- $config_helptext = 1 displayes a small helptext for every page of PHPrcon. Set this to 0 and no helptext will be displayed.

- if $config_localserver is set to 1, you may edit config files from your gameserver. The config files are set in $config_file[1], $config_file[2] .... increase the number in $config_file[ ] by 1 each time you add a new file. Use only absolute paths. If you want to disable this feature set $config_localserver to 0.


Troubleshooting
---------------

- If your IP is valid, but there is no Halflife Server listening on your PORT, PHPrcon will not be able to cast a proper error message. A fatal error will be displayed after the "max_execution_time". The "max_execution_time" is specified in your Webserver config.

- If $config_map_amount is greater than the number of pages being sent from the gameserver, your browser will not stop loading the page until the PHP max_execution_time exceeded.

- If your webserver has PHP installed as CGI, you will not be able to download the "config.php". Please Copy&Paste the displayed "config.php" into a "config.php" in the "./config/" folder, where "." is your PHPrcon root directory.
